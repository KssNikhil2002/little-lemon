# little-lemon
This is the Capstone Project for my Meta Android Developer Professional Certificate.

I have created the Little Lemon Application for a restaurant "Little Lemon" using Android Studio SDK using Kotlin Language
It has features like:
 - Onboarding Screen
 - Search Functionality
 - Database
 - Profile Screen
 - Home Screen that displays the different dishes
